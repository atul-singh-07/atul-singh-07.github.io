  <h1>Atul Singh</h1>
  <p>
    I enjoy building things where <strong>hardware, code, and logic</strong> come together.
    Most of my learning happens by experimenting, breaking things, and understanding
    why they work the way they do.
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>What I’m Interested In</h2>
    <p>
      I have a strong interest in electronics and embedded systems, but I don’t see hardware
      as separate from software. For me, electronics becomes meaningful when it interacts
      with code — controlling motion, sensing the environment, and responding in real time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>How I Like to Build</h2>
    <p>
      I prefer project-based learning over purely theoretical study. I enjoy working on
      small systems that combine microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and C/C++ code.
    </p>
    <p>
      While building, I focus on understanding behavior, debugging issues, and improving
      reliability step by step — both in hardware connections and in software logic.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Things I’ve Worked On</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Arduino-based projects involving sensors, motors, and real-time interaction</li>
      <li>Servo motor control using external power sources and proper grounding</li>
      <li>Ultrasonic sensor experiments for distance measurement and scanning</li>
      <li>C programming concepts explored through hands-on problem solving</li>
      <li>Small system-level projects that mix timing, logic, and hardware control</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="box">
    <h2>Currently Exploring</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my foundations in both electronics and
      programming, with the goal of building more stable and well-structured systems.
      I’m especially curious about how low-level code interacts directly with hardware.
